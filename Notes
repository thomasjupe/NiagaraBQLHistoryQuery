  Notes for BQL Stuff to investigate

    Research:
        BQL Timestamps / Time / etc



    Explore:
      You can use a combination of NEQL and BQL 
      sys:|neql:n:point|bql:select parent.parent.name as 'Equip', name as 'Point', out as 'Value' where status.isOverridden=true

      The Having clause - Must have an aggrigate such as SUM, MIN, MAX, AVE
      |bql:select displayName, Sum(out.value) from control:NumericPoint having Sum(out.value) > 50

      OrderBy - BQL query can be sorted using the Order By clause. Ordering can be ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC). If no order is specified, ASC order is used.
      |bql:select slotPath, displayName, out.value from control:NumericPoint order by out.value DESC
      |bql:select slotPath, displayName, out.value from control:NumericPoint order by slotPath, displayName DESC

      Look into how to resolve a BQL Query in Java

      Using WebWidget with a BQL Query limit js view:report:HTML5BqlGridTable with Wb View Binding with ord to BQLGrid

      period=timeRange;start=YYYY-MM-DD-?????;end=

    Add to:
      Alarms : alarm:|bql:select * where uuid = Uuid '[enter UUID]'
      Alarms : Message Texts are formatted at display time so call BFormat.make(alarmDataMsgText).format(alarmRecord) if you want to display it.
      Alarms : station:|slot:/|bql:select * from alarm:AlarmSourceExt where alarmInhibit.boolean = 'true'
      Alarms : station:|slot:/|bql:select parent.name as 'Point Name',parent.out as 'Point Status' from alarm:AlarmSourceExt where alarmInhibit.boolean = 'true'
      Alarms : station:|slot:/|bql:select * from alarm:AlarmSourceExt where alarmInhibit.boolean = 'true'|bql:size 

      Misc : station:|slot:/|bql:select name as 'Point Name',out as 'Point Status' from control:ControlPoint where status.overridden = 'true'

      Schedules : station:|slot:/|bql:select parent.parent.parent.displayName as 'Schedule',days as 'Event Date',displayName as 'Day Of Week',day.time.start as 'Occ1',day.time.finish as 'Unocc1',day.time1.start as 'Occ2',day.time1.finish as 'Unocc2' from schedule:DailySchedule
