//All Link Marks in Station Query
//Works for AX or NX
//I use this query in my workflow in instances where a station N4Mig is not compatible with the IO and link marks and need changing to new modules. Additionally as a sanity check to quickly check all IO is linkMarked into strategy.

//To run this query on any station either running in your sandbox, in user home or on a controller open config in workbench and press ctrl+L go to the end of the string and paste the full BQL query from below from : |bql:select parent.name as 'Poi....to....or targetSlotName = 'in16'
//You can specify individual 'in' slots by deleting unwanted slots. This version searches all slots by default.
