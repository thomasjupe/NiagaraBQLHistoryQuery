  Notes for BQL Stuff to investigate

    Test:
        |bql:size
        On history:     timestamp.year = 2023
                        timestamp.month.ordinal = '10'
                        timestamp.day = 1


    Explore:
      You can use a combination of NEQL and BQL 
      sys:|neql:n:point|bql:select parent.parent.name as 'Equip', name as 'Point', out as 'Value' where status.isOverridden=true

      The Having clause - Must have an aggrigate such as SUM, MIN, MAX, AVE
      |bql:select displayName, Sum(out.value) from control:NumericPoint having Sum(out.value) > 50

      OrderBy - BQL query can be sorted using the Order By clause. Ordering can be ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC). If no order is specified, ASC order is used.
      |bql:select slotPath, displayName, out.value from control:NumericPoint order by out.value DESC
      |bql:select slotPath, displayName, out.value from control:NumericPoint order by slotPath, displayName DESC

      Look into how to resolve a BQL Query in Java for BQL Expression component {kitcontrol>Utilities}

      Using WebWidget with a BQL Query limit js view:report:HTML5BqlGridTable with Wb View Binding with ord to BQLGrid
      ExportSource component (report) source export to csv via the file:ITableToCsv action Bind Buttons to generate report and display it in GUI

      period=timeRange;start=YYYY-MM-DD-?????;end=

      //Displays in a bound label the first cell of a query 
      |cell:0,0 
      //cell:[Column,Row]

      On Target BNumericWritable inherits attributes from BNumericPoint


    Add to: 

      Misc : station:|slot:/|bql:select name as 'Point Name',out as 'Point Status' from control:ControlPoint where status.overridden = 'true'
      Misc :   //Number of points in override
              bql:select count(status) as 'Overridden Count' from control:ControlPoint where status.isOverridden=true
              bql:select count(status) from control:ControlPoint where status.isOverridden=true|cell:0,0
                                                                  (Test) status.overridden=true

      Misc :   Niagara query to display all Niagara stations showing IP address and Software Version
              station:|slot:/|bql:select name as 'Station Name',slotPathOrd as 'Path',address as 'Ip Address',version as 'Software Version' from niagaraDriver:niagaraStation where status.overridden = 'true'
              bql:|version =! '4.12*' (TEST)


      Schedules : station:|slot:/|bql:select parent.parent.parent.displayName as 'Schedule',days as 'Event Date',displayName as 'Day Of Week',day.time.start as 'Occ1',day.time.finish as 'Unocc1',day.time1.start as 'Occ2',day.time1.finish as 'Unocc2' from schedule:DailySchedule
        
      All : If you are using ?period=[time] and want to enter the BQL Query wizard you need to delete it as the BQL Query wizard does not recognise it. 

      station:|slot:/|bql:select name as 'name',proxyExt.objectId as 'ObjectID',slotPath as 'Path' from baja:Component where proxyExt.objectId = 'analogInput:10'

station:|slot:/|bql:select name as 'name'from bacnet:BacnetDevice
